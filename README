NAME: AlignmentEvaluation

DESCRIPTION 

A tool for evaluation of absolute alignment error. 
Done to evaluate results of a system for lyrics-2-audio alignment. Usable evaluation for any token-based alignment (e.g. if token is word, phrase, note, section )
Considers    begin timestamp and end timestamp of each token: 
 
 detected file format :  mlf format of htk
 annotation file format: TextGrid of Praat 
 
Algorithm does not try to map token identities between detected result and annotation, but proceeds successively one-by-one

EXAMPLE: if decoded result is:
 
startTs endTs phonemeOrWord
0.0		1.11	sil
1.11	2.41	usagi
2.41	2.90	usagi
2.90	3.38	sp
3.38	4.15	nani

and annotation <>.TextGrid is 
beginTs 	usagi usagi 
endTs 	nani

Then the two detected phrases are considered to evaluate:  
1.11 2.90 usagi usagi 
and 
3.38 4.15	nani


To change extensions edit variables in WordLevelEvaluator 
ANNOTATION_EXT = '.TextGrid'
DETECTED_EXT = '.dtwDurationAligned'

TODO: change names in module evaluation.WordLevelEvaluator.evalAlignmentError to be coherent.
